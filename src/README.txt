in order to run the game, run SpaceInvaders.java

WARNING:
The game sometimes fails to function when ran in certain directories. 
We do not know why this keeps occurring or how to fix it properly, 
which is why we wanted to give a warning, sometimes the program functions after taking it out of 
the root on certain devices, or when placed in another directory it could work spontaneously.
